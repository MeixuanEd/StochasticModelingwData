# Data-driven Stochastic Modeling
The framework proposed in  *"Data-driven modeling of strongly nonlinear chaoticsystems with non-Gaussian statistics"*
 by H. Arbabi and T. Sapsis.
 
Given time series data on a measure-preserving chaotic system, this framework generates a system of SDEs with nonlinear observation maps which produce the similar statsitics and spectra as the time series. Here is the schematic representation:
