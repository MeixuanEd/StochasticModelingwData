# Data-driven Stochastic Modeling
Data-driven modeling of chaotic systems in the form of linear SDEs and nonlinear observation maps
following the paper
*"Data-driven modeling of strongly nonlinear chaoticsystems with non-Gaussian statistics"*
 by H. Arbabi and T. Sapsis.
 
 The Koopman-MPC framework is summarized in the below figure:
